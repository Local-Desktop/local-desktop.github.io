## Issue

When debugging your Android app in Visual Studio Code for the first time, you might encounter this error:

1. Open VS Code Settings (<kbd>âŒ˜ + ,</kbd> on Mac, <kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd> on Windows/Linux)
2. Search for `Android-debug: Ndk Root`
3. Set the path to your Android NDK installation directory
